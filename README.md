# RN_DEMO
//This syntax is basically array destructuring
//Ex: colors=['red','green']
//console.log(colors) will give 'red','green'
//Similarly const [colorOne,colorTwo] = colors, will give outputs as,
//console.log(colorOne)="red", and console.log(colorTwo)="green"

// const [counter,setCounter] = useState(0)
//useState is used to initialize the counter state
//Whenever setCounter(), is called, the entire functional component gets re-rendered,and updated value of counter gets 
//displayed.
//We cannot directly modify state as counter=counter+1
//It has to be modified via setter function, setCounter(counter+1)
